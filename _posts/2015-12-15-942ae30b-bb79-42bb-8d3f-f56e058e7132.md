"...brings to mind King's Dark Tower series...."

...a great combination of the weird, supernatural world with

a thoroughly Western vibe..."

- Five Star Amazon Review

"You are in for some mind-blowing storytelling."

- Steve Vernon, Author

"I spent every free moment and tore through Bain's book

in a day and loved it." 

- Five Star Amazon Review

COMING JANUARY 2016

FIRST BOOK IN A NEW SERIES!

Readers have long asked author David Bain for more
stories on Gentleman Jim "The Demon Duelist" Brodie and Dr. Darius 
Darke from his story "The Cowboys of Cthulhu." Well - here you be, pard!

RIDERS WHERE THERE ARE NO ROADS is the first full novel in the Riders of the Weird West series.

There's roping, riding, an interdimensional 
badass, shootouts, demon cowboys, a dragon, a pickup that's really a 
horse (or is it the other way around?) and a mystical biker/cosmic 
Marshal who might just be orchestrating it all!

David Bain is the author of DEATH SIGHT, the 
first novel in the Will Castleton psychic detective series, GRAY LAKE: A
NOVEL OF CRIME AND SUPERNATURAL HORROR and several short story 
collections. He teaches writing at a community college in Indiana.
